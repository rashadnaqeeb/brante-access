    /// attributes and skills, with the experience/points readout and the Revert Level Up button stacked
    /// under it). Arrows move within the grid, and Down from the grid's bottom row spills down through the
    /// status readout and the revert button (Up returns). The game's Overview/Info tabs are not surfaced -
    /// the skill line already folds in both their contents, so the toggles would do nothing for a
    /// screen-reader user.
    ///
    /// The grid mirrors the screen - each attribute (read-only, see <see cref="AttributeCell"/>) as column
    /// zero, then its six skills across, four attribute rows top to bottom (Intellect, Psyche, Physique,
    /// Motorics). Up/Down move between attributes keeping the column, Left/Right along a row. Each skill
    /// (<see cref="LevelUpSkillCell"/>) reads its name, value, signature and "can raise" markers, short
    /// description, and its full info-panel detail (bonus breakdown then long description) folded onto the
    /// one line, and on Enter spends a skill point when one is available. The status readout
    /// (<see cref="CharStatusCell"/>) is experience and unspent skill points. Escape closes the sheet
    /// (<see cref="ScreenRoot"/>).
    ///
    /// The charsheet's panels are instantiated a frame or two after the view transition, so the first build
    /// can find none: <see cref="OnUpdate"/> repopulates in place once they appear (and while their counts
    /// settle), re-homing focus. Nothing is focusable until the grid is populated, so focus lands on the
    /// grid, not the detail region, on entry.

    /// bonuses, its completion description, and the game's accept button; Escape accepts through that same
    /// button. Auto-speak follows the Automatically read dialogue setting the way conversations and the
    /// newspaper do: entry announces the screen and lands on the name, the bonuses and description are
    /// queued only when the setting is on - off leaves them one arrow away.

    /// Accepting with more finished thoughts queued swaps the next one into the view in place (the game
    /// pops <c>discoveredThoughts</c> with no view transition), so <see cref="OnUpdate"/> watches the
    /// displayed project and re-homes to the new thought's name. The bonuses are read from the view's own
    /// composed text (each effect plus its flavor line, the exact lines a sighted player sees); the name
    /// and description come from the project model, which the view mirrors verbatim.
